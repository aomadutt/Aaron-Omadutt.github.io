## Introduction

My name is Aaron Omadutt, I am a recent graduate from Swarthmore College with a B.S. in Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics. My academic and practical experience has provided me with a strong foundation in engineering principles and mathematical analysis, which I have applied to a variety of projects.


## Education

I graduated in May 2024 with a GPA of 3.30. My coursework included Thermofluid Mechanics, Aerodynamics, and Computer-Aided Manufacturing and Procedural Design, equipping me with a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of engineering.

## Experience

As an Undergraduate R&D Engineer at Swarthmore College, I developed a robotic model to replicate the swimming techniques of barnacle larvae, focusing on hydrodynamic analysis to investigate the significance of body extensions. This project involved optimizing Nitinol springs for actuation, integrating microcontrollers with 3D-printed components, and designing a compact robotic system. I presented this research at the SICB Conference, where I was recognized as a Best Student Presentation Finalist.

## Key Projects

**Robotic Model Barnacle Nauplii**
Developed a robotic model to simulate barnacle nauplii swimming techniques, utilizing Nitinol springs and microcontrollers. Created a compact design with 3D-printed components and a custom PCB.

** 4-Wheel Independent Steering Drivetrain **
Led a team in creating an omni-directional robot for industrial applications, implementing swerve drive kinematics and computer vision for object detection and navigation.

** Wind Tunnel Testing and Airfoil Analysis **
Modeled and tested a NACA 1412 airfoil, utilizing MATLAB for data analysis and simulation to optimize aerodynamic performance.

** High Power Model Rocket: **
Modeled and constructed a rocket with advanced features such as a calibrated electronics bay for parachute deployment, leveraging tools like OpenRocket and Fusion 360.

** Heart Rate Monitor **
Built an ECG system with microcontrollers and an INA114 amplifier for heart rate detection. Developed a MATLAB script to identify peaks, ensuring accuracy by cross-verifying with existing data.

** Bearing Box **
Designed a cylindrical box in Fusion360 to simulate bearing movements using marbles. Configured CAM toolpaths for CNC milling the box from RenShape. Developed Python scripts to generate G-code for engraving randomized Piet Mondrian designs on the lid.


# Skills
I am proficient in technologies such as Fusion360, SOLIDWORKS, and OpenRocket, and I am skilled in programming languages including MATLAB, Python, Java, and C/C++. My prototyping and fabrication skills include 3D printing, CNC machining, and PCB schematic design.
