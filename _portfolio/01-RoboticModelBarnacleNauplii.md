Like most crustaceans, barnacles have a naupliar form that has three pairs of limbs, which are used in both feeding and swimming. Furthermore, they all have the taxon-defining pair of frontal horns. Body extensions, as such, can influence the hydrodynamics of the larvae by acting as sea anchors. To better understand the role of body extensions and their interactions with limb motion in larval function, we set forth to develop a robotic system to analyze the swimming pattern of barnacle nauplii. To ensure the robot was lightweight and compact, Nitinol springs were used as a substitution for conventional motors. Springs were controlled with a microcontroller that could either enable the flow of electrical current through the springs, causing them to heat up and contract, or halt the current flow, allowing the springs to cool down and expand. Utilizing a series of springs, microcontrollers, and 3D-printed components, the cyclic motion of the nauplius's power and recovery stroke within their swimming pattern was successfully replicated. In future, this robotic model will undergo testing in a viscous fluid, and particle image velocimetry will be used to analyze the flow patterns during the robot's free swimming. The development of this robotic system helps inform the role of body extensions in low to intermediate Re swimmers and, more broadly, the evolution of planktonic larval form.
