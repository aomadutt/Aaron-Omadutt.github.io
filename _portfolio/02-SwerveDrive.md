For my senior capstone engineering project, my team and I designed, assembled, and programmed an omni-directional robot equipped with a web camera to intelligently sort and transfer colored boxes. The project aimed to simulate an industrial workplace setting, optimizing sorting processes. Developing a robot with high maneuverability combined with object detection capabilities could prove to be useful in optimizing workflows in warehouses and processing factories where items constantly need to be located and transported. With three group members, each with their own specializations, the project was divided up into elctro-mechanical prototyping/development, implemention of swerve drive kinematics with software, and integration of object/color detection with computer vision software.
