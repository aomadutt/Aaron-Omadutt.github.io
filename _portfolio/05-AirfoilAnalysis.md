This project focused on modeling and fabricating a NACA 1412 airfoil using Fusion 360 and 3D printing. Mounted in a wind tunnel, the airfoil's pressure distribution and wake characteristics were experimentally analyzed, with data collected using MATLAB. The study explored how changes in airfoil features—such as trailing edge, leading edge, camber, and chord length—influence drag and lift coefficients as functions of angle of attack. Results showed that increasing the angle of attack raised both coefficients until stalling began around 20 degrees, causing a drop in lift. The project also investigated how various airfoil designs could optimize lift and delay stall, enhancing overall flight performance. These experimentally determined parameters were then applied in simulation software to further refine and optimize the airfoil design.
