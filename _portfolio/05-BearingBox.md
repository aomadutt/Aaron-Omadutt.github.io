In the Bearing Box project, a cylindrical box was designed using Fusion360 to simulate bearing movements with marbles. The design was  configured for CNC milling from RenShape using CAM toolpaths. Additionally, Python scripts were developed to generate G-code, which enabled the engraving of randomized Piet Mondrian designs on the boxâ€™s lid. This project combined computer-aided engineering design with CNC fabrication techniques to create a functional and visually unique product.
