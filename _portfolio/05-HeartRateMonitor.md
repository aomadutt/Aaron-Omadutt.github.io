An electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement system was designed and built to detect heart rate. The system incorporated microcontrollers and an INA114 instrumentation amplifier, configured with a 5V power supply in Lead I configuration for precise heart rate detection. A MATLAB script was developed to identify heart rate peaks, which was integrated into the system. Accuracy was ensured by cross-verifying the calculated heart rate against existing data, demonstrating the system's reliability and effectiveness in monitoring cardiac activity.
