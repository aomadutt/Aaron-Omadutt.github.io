The differential, a crucial mechanical device invented in 1827 by On√©siphore Pecqueur, has significantly advanced the maneuverability of wheeled vehicles. In automotive robotics, modeling path trajectories and object avoidance is vital for efficient robot navigation and safety. This project leverages insights from Lynch et al., Szczepanski et al., and Knights et al. to develop a model for a differential drivetrain robot. By applying kinematics and differential equations, the project aims to optimize path-following and obstacle avoidance, enhancing the robot's performance and integration into various automotive applications. This work evaluates the drivetrain's dynamics to compare its effectiveness against other systems, demonstrating its strengths and limitations.
